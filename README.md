# Time Schedule
I already work long hours (10 hours) so dedicating most of my time will not be problem. 
I plan to spend at least weekday hours from 08H00 to 17H00 since during the day some people are at work and some at school. 
Also, it will make my routine easy if I take short breaks in-between and allow my brain to digest whatever information I put into it. 
During weekends, I will spend a few hours checking for any updates and preparing for the coming week. 
Because I am a night-owl, Iâ€™m also planning on trying to work during the night and see if it works and if not, quickly change to the day routine.
